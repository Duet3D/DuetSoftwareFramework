Summary of important changes in recent versions
===============================================

Version 2.0.0
==============
Compatible files:
- RepRapFirmware 3.01-RC8
- DuetWebControl 2.1.3

Changed behaviour:
- M999 stops DCS. This behaviour can be changed by starting it with the `-r` command-line argument or by changing the config value `NoTerminateOnReset` to `true`
- Plugins using prior API versions are no longer compatible and require new versions of the API libraries
- Codes M21+M22 are not supported and will throw an error
- Code expressions are now preparsed and Linux object model fields are substituted before the final evaluation

Known issues:
- Conditional G-codes (aka meta commands) except for echo are not supported yet
- Print/Simulation times are not written to G-code files
- Comments for object cancellation detection are not parsed (work-around is to use M486 directly)

Bug fixes:
- Added compatibility for G-code meta expressions
- When all macros were aborted the messages were not properly propagated to the start code(s)
- Some codes were incorrectly sent when aborting all files
- Some macro codes could be executed in the wrong order when multiple macros were invoked
- Code requests from the firmware could cause a deadlock
