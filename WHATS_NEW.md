Version 2.1.0
==============

Compatible files:

- Added new fields stepsPerMm and microstepping to Axis amd Extruder items to DuetAPI

- Removed SpiPollDelaySimulating and renamed SpiPollDelaySimulating to FileBufferSize in the DCS settings (the latter is now used for code files, too)
- Simple text-based codes no longer report when they are cancelled

Known issues:
- Print/Simulation times are not written to G-code files
- Comments for object cancellation detection are not parsed (work-around is to use M486 directly)

- Fixed deadlock that could occur when the SPI task tried to resolve pending requests
- M20 was not fully compatible with RRF
- Concatenating code parser exception caused the line to be appended multiple times

- Codes of macros being cancelled were sometimes aborted with a wrong exception

Version 2.0.0
==============
Compatible files:
- RepRapFirmware 3.01-RC8

Changed behaviour:
- M999 stops DCS. This behaviour can be changed by starting it with the `-r` command-line argument or by changing the config value `NoTerminateOnReset` to `true`

Known issues:
- Conditional G-codes (aka meta commands) except for echo are not supported yet
- Print/Simulation times are not written to G-code files
- Comments for object cancellation detection are not parsed (work-around is to use M486 directly)
