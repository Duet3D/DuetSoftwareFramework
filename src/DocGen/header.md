This page refers to version 3.3 of the Object Model.

All Duet software projects share the same object model to store configuration and sensor data.
This page provides documentation about the different object model keys and associated properties.

Some fields may not be available in standalone mode because some fields are only maintained by DSF and/or DWC.
It is advised to consider this when developing applications that address Duets in standalone *and* SBC mode.
